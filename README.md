# BhyatPOS

**BhyatPOS** is a point-of-sale application currently approaching its Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage. Built with C# and .NET using Avalonia UI, it offers a modern, cross-platform desktop interface. The app uses SQLite for lightweight local data storage, handling sales transactions, inventory management, and reporting.

Designed with modularity, BhyatPOS includes views for Sales, Inventory, Dashboard, Reports, and Settings to cover essential business needs. While still in development, it emphasizes ease of use, data integrity, and scalability. Future updates plan to introduce cloud sync to back up data and support multi-device access.
